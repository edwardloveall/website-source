A native Texan transplanted in Boston, I fell in love with programming in high
school, and made it a career in adulthood.

Currently, I get paid to write [Swift] and [Objective-C] for [thoughtbot].
For some reason, they also keep letting me pretend to write [Haskell].

I root for [The First Place Houston Astros][astros], and lift weights at [Forever
Crossfit][fcf].
