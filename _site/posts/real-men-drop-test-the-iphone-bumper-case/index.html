<p>Really? A glorified $30 rubber band successfully protects a $600 solid glass mobile device from a 3' fall onto concrete 2 times with little to no damage, and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;insufficient for most iPhone protection needs&rdquo;? In what world do we live in that most people are expected to drop their phones from 3 feet on a regular basis?</p>
