		<blockquote><p>I like to pay for things and here is why</p></blockquote>

<p>Exactly how I feel on the matter. I purchased LaunchBar as well once QS became sufficiently annoying to use on a day to day basis. I have been a happily paying Dropbox Pro user for going on 2 years, because they are a service I simply can&rsquo;t live without. I have licenses for Things, and 1Password on both the Mac and iOS sides of the equation, because they are the best tools for the job. Please, if at all possible, let me give you my money so you can keep making your awesome products.</p>
