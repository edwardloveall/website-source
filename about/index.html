	<p>For the past 3 years, I have been working at <a href="http://www.wheelstvnetwork.com">WheelsTV</a>. I currently work as Senior 
	Editor/Production Manager, managing WheelsTV's team of editors, assistants, and writers. 
	Previously, I helped to develop and was lead editor on <a href="http://www.autotrader.com">Autotrader.com</a>'s proprietary 
	car reviews<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Over the years, I have also been in charge of editing WheelsTV's 
	various products, including <a href="http://wheelstvnetwork.com/products/100-on-one/">1:00 on ONE</a> and helping develop and produce 
	WheelsTV's <a href="http://wheelstvnetwork.com/products/pov-reviews/">Previously Owned Vehicle Reviews</a>. I have also worked extensively 
	designing motion graphics for various projects.</p>
	
	<p>Off and on for the better part of 6 years, I have been employed by 
	<a href="http://www.cdiabu.com">Boston University Center For Digital Imaging Arts</a>. Initially hired in late 
	2006 as a teaching assistant, I moved on to be promoted to Media Manager, where I worked 
	to  create marketing videos for the school's web presence. Since becoming employed at 
	WheelsTV, I have worked frequently as a part-time Final Cut Pro instructor.</p>
	
	<p>Recently, I was the Director of Photography for the pilot of <a href="http://www.whenigrowupshow.com">When I Grow Up</a>, a 
	documentary-style TV show following <a href="http://www.twitter.com/harmonixsean">Sean Baptiste</a> as he attempts to do all the 
	jobs he wanted to do as a child.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to film editing, I have had a life-long obsession with technology and 
	development. This came to a head last year, when I decided to pick learn Objective-C in 
	order to develop his beer logging app for iOS, <a href="http://www.hopsapp.com">Hops</a>. I've also been getting more and 
	more interested in web technologies, such as <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, and <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. I 
	built a little web app called <a href="/posts/wishboard/">Wishboard</a> that I use to track my personal wishlist.</p>
	
	<p>I am constantly looking for new problems to solve with technology, and put almost all of 
	my development work on <a href="http://www.github.com/gfontenot">GitHub</a> for the public to browse and mock.</p>
	
	<p>A full list of films and code projects can be found on the <a href="/projects">Projects page</a>.</p>
	
	<p>I currently live in Waltham, MA, and dream of my hometown of Fredericksburg, 
	Texas on a regular basis.</p>
