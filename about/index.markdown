#Gordon Ridley Fontenot

Gordon can be contacted easily [on Twitter][twitter], or just as easily <a href='&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#103;&#111;&#114;&#100;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#102;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#101;&#110;&#111;&#116;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;'>&#118;&#105;&#97;&#32;&#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;</a>.

For the past 2 years, Gordon has been working at [WheelsTV][] as a full-time editor. He currently works as Senior Editor on [Autotrader.com][]'s proprietary car reviews, which can be seen on Autotrader's site, as well as on their [YouTube channel][AT-YouTube]. In the past, he has been in charge of editing WheelsTV's various products, including [1:00 on ONE][WTV-1on1] and helping develop and produce WheelsTV's Previously Owned Vehicle Reviews, or [POV][WTV-POV]. He has also worked extensively designing motion graphics for various projects, and occasionally steps in as the resident code-monkey.

Off and on for the better part of 6 years, he has been employed by [Boston University Center For Digital Imaging Arts][BUCDIA]. Initially hired in late 2006 as a teaching assistant, he moved on to be promoted to Media Manager, where he was tasked with creating marketing videos for the school's web presence. Since becoming employed at WheelsTV, he has worked frequently as a part-time Final Cut Pro instructor.

He has also been associated with some very interesting freelance projects in recent years. Most recently, he was the Director of Photography for the pilot of [When I Grow Up][], a documentary-style TV show following [Sean Baptiste][] as he attempts to do all the jobs he wanted to do as a child. Also of note, Gordon edited the comedy short (5 minutes) [The Policy][]; a short film about Jesus meeting with his Life Insurance agent after the crucifixion.

Gordon also dabbles in code from time to time. He has created an iOS app for beer logging and rating, that he lovingly calls [Hops][].

A full list of films and code projects can be found on the [Projects page][].

Gordon currently lives in Waltham, MA, and dreams of his hometown of Fredericksburg, Texas on a regular basis.
