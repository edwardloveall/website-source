For the past 3 years, I have been working at [WheelsTV][]. I currently work as Senior 
Editor/Production Manager, managing WheelsTV's team of editors, assistants, and writers. 
Previously, I helped to develop and was lead editor on [Autotrader.com][]'s proprietary 
car reviews[^1]. Over the years, I have also been in charge of editing WheelsTV's 
various products, including [1:00 on ONE][WTV-1on1] and helping develop and produce 
WheelsTV's [Previously Owned Vehicle Reviews][WTV-POV]. I have also worked extensively 
designing motion graphics for various projects.

[^1]: These can be seen on Autotrader's site, as well as on their 
[YouTube channel][AT-YouTube]

Off and on for the better part of 6 years, I have been employed by 
[Boston University Center For Digital Imaging Arts][BUCDIA]. Initially hired in late 
2006 as a teaching assistant, I moved on to be promoted to Media Manager, where I worked 
to  create marketing videos for the school's web presence. Since becoming employed at 
WheelsTV, I have worked frequently as a part-time Final Cut Pro instructor.

Recently, I was the Director of Photography for the pilot of [When I Grow Up][], a 
documentary-style TV show following [Sean Baptiste][] as he attempts to do all the 
jobs he wanted to do as a child.

In addition to film editing, I have had a life-long obsession with technology and 
development. This came to a head last year, when I decided to pick learn Objective-C in 
order to develop his beer logging app for iOS, [Hops][]. I've also been getting more and 
more interested in web technologies, such as [Ruby on Rails][RoR], and [Sinatra][]. I 
built a little web app called [Wishboard][] that I use to track my personal wishlist.

I am constantly looking for new problems to solve with technology, and put almost all of 
my development work on [GitHub][] for the public to browse and mock.

A full list of films and code projects can be found on the [Projects page][].

I currently live in Waltham, MA, and dream of my hometown of Fredericksburg, 
Texas on a regular basis.
