> itâ€™s abundantly clear that the bumper case is insufficient for most iPhone protection needs and should be taken out back and shot.

Really? A glorified $30 rubber band successfully protects a $600 solid glass mobile device from a 3' fall onto concrete 2 times with little to no damage, and it's "insufficient for most iPhone protection needs"? In what world do we live in that most people are expected to drop their phones from 3 feet on a regular basis?
